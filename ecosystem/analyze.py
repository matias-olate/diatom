        This method evaluates either the feasibility of a grid point or computes
        qualitative flux variability information, optionally updating reaction
        bounds according to community member fractions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        grid_point : np.ndarray, shape (2,)
            Grid coordinates defining the community state. The first coordinate corresponds to the 
            fraction of total biomass growth assigned to member 1, and the second coordinate corresponds 
            to the total community biomass production rate.

            Internally, this is transformed into per-member biomass growth rates:
                mu_1 = fraction * mu_total
                mu_2 = (1 - fraction) * mu_total

        member_fractions : np.ndarray or None, shape (n_members,)
            Relative abundance of each community member. These fractions are used to scale reaction 
            bounds when `update_bounds=True`. If all entries are NaN, they are interpreted as zero 
            to avoid invalid bound updates.

            This argument is ignored when `update_bounds=False`.

        analysis : {"feasibility", "qual_fva"}, default="feasibility"
            Type of analysis to perform:
            - "feasibility": checks whether the grid point admits a feasible solution.
            - "qual_fva": computes qualitative flux variability categories for a selected set of reactions.

        update_bounds : bool, default=False
            If True, reaction bounds are scaled according to member fractions before running the analysis. 
            Bound updates are temporary and must be executed inside the model context manager.

        delta : float, default=1e-9
            Numerical tolerance used when translating flux variability ranges into
            qualitative categories. Only relevant for `analysis="qual_fva"`.

        Returns
        -------
        bool
            If `analysis="feasibility"`, returns True if the grid point is feasible,
            False otherwise.

        tuple
            If `analysis="qual_fva"`, returns a tuple `(qual_vector, fva_values)`:
            - qual_vector : list[int]
                Qualitative category assigned to each reaction.
            - fva_values : np.ndarray, shape (n_reactions, 2)
                Minimum and maximum flux values obtained from FVA.

        Notes
        -----
        All model mutations (reaction bound updates and objective fixing) are performed inside a 
        `with community_model:` context. This guarantees that all changes are reverted after the 
        analysis is completed.
